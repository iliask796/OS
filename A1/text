Years before the present rebels from the repressed undercity of Zaun
march across a bridge into Piltover
resulting in the brutal pushback of the Piltover enforcers
During the ensuing violence sisters Powder and Vi
find their parents dead in the rubble and
are taken in by Vander the leader of the failed rebellion
In the present Vi and Powder rob a Piltover penthouse with their adopted brothers Mylo and Claggor
Powder steals a set of magical crystals, accidentally shattering one
when the owner of the penthouse returns
The resulting explosion destroys a large portion of the building and
alerts enforcers to their presence, whom they narrowly escape
Returning to the undercity, the siblings encounter Deckard and his thugs
while they beat them in a fistfight, Powder is chased and loses the loot
Vander, now a barman and de facto leader of much of the undercity, scolds the children
for their carelessness and attempts to smooth things over with Grayson (enforcer sheriff)
Vi berates Mylo for calling Powder a "jinx" and reassures her sister that things will get better
In the lowest parts of the undercity, crime-lord Silco extracts information from Deckard and
tests a new mutagen known as Shimmer
